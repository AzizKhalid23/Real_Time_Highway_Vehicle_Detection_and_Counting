# Real_Time_Highway_Vehicle_Detection_and_Counting
A real-time vehicle detection and counting system using YOLOv8. The model identifies cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles from highway video footage and displays bounding boxes with predicted classes. Built with Python, OpenCV, and Ultralytics YOLO.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The goal of this project is to identify and count vehicles in real-time from a video stream using a pre-trained YOLOv8 model. The model draws bounding boxes around detected vehicles and optionally displays their class labels.

## ðŸ§  Technology Stack

- **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** for object detection
- **OpenCV** for video processing and display
- **Supervision** library for enhanced visualization
- **Python & Jupyter Notebook** for development

## ðŸ“¦ Key Features

- Real-time object detection on highway videos
- Class-specific filtering: detects cars, motorcycles, buses, and trucks
- Easy switch between YOLO model sizes (`yolov8n.pt`, `yolov8s.pt`, etc.)
- Live video display with bounding boxes and optional FPS/vehicle count
